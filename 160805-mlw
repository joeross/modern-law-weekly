Hey friends, remember me? It's been a while... Eight months, actually. I know, I know. But I've been busy, as I'm sure all of you have been, too. I'm working at a great new job, in the process of starting some really cool projects and recently moved into a house with my wife. But I like sharing links with other curious people, so Modern Law is back. I'm going to try something new, too. Each week I'm going to pick a broad topic and the links will all relate to that topic. This week's topic is **criminal law**.

### **Longform**: [My Four Months as a Private Prison Guard](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer)

> I started applying for jobs in private prisons because I wanted to see the inner workings of an industry that holds 131,000 of the nation's 1.6 million prisoners. As a journalist, it's nearly impossible to get an unconstrained look inside our penal system. When prisons do let reporters in, it's usually for carefully managed tours and monitored interviews with inmates. Private prisons are especially secretive. Their records often aren't subject to public access laws; CCA has fought to defeat legislation that would make private prisons subject to the same disclosure rules as their public counterparts. And even if I could get uncensored information from private prison inmates, how would I verify their claims? I keep coming back to this question: Is there any other way to see what really happens inside a private prison?

Yes, there is: get a job at one. But be prepared for pitfalls of immersive journalism.

### **Trial**: [Hannah Wilson murder weapon may have been flashlight, prosecutors allege](http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/03/affected-hannah-wilsons-death-cab-driver-quit-after-taking-her-home/88005764/)

> Brown County Prosecutor Ted Adams said in opening statements that circumstantial evidence points to Messel. His cell phone was found at Wilson's feet. Police arrested him as he carried a bag of bloody clothes. Adams said Wilson's blood was found in his Kia Sportage.

Circumstantial? Yes. Damning as hell? Also yes.

### **Interactive**: [Gone: One wife dead. Two others missing.](http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/gone/)

> “Gone” tells the story of Mississippi native Felix Vail and the people whose paths he crossed. Vail goes on trial Aug. 8 in Lake Charles, Louisiana — the oldest prosecution of a serial-killer suspect in U.S. history. Vail is charged in the 1962 death of his first wife, and authorities suspect he is connected to the disappearances of two other women.

This amazing piece of multimedia investigative journalism includes nine articles and five videos. If you're the kind of person who goes deep into a story, this is the link for you.

### **Ongoing Investigation**: [Police Tie 9th Attack to Phoenix's Serial Killer Case](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-tie-9th-attack-phoenixs-serial-killer-case-41104937)

> Authorities investigating the first serial killer in Phoenix in a decade said Wednesday that they have linked a non-fatal shooting to the case, bringing the number of attacks under examination to nine.

It's important to remember that serial killers are not merely a movie trope. They still happen, and one evil person is all it takes to terrorize an entire city.

### **Cold Case**: [Monroe mystery continues in unsolved murder of 5-year-old Nevaeh](http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/140958191-story)

> Not knowing who killed 5-year-old Nevaeh Buchanan still keeps her grandmother up at night. It has been nearly 7 years since little Nevaeh disappeared outside her mother's Monroe apartment complex.

This is heartbreaking, obviously. There's nothing else to say, so I'll share another quote from the article:

> There is still a $50,000 reward for anyone who provides information leading to an arrest created by money from the FBI, Crime Stoppers, an anonymous donor and Justice For Nevaeh. if anyone has any information call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP you can stay anonymous.
